# My City
This project is an example of Google Maps location service for specific community. The repository aims to serve as personal portfolio representing skills in web development with Javascript, React, Express, and Cloud services.

### Main dependencies
* [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Node.js framework for backend computing
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend framework for client application
* [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) - Cloud service for representing maps and pin locations in the web application

### Cloud Services
The cloud services used in this project are
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Backend API deployment
* AWS S3 - Client application deployment
* AWS DynamoDB - NoSQL database
* AWS SNS - Notification service
* Google Maps Platform - Maps and location service

### Styling framework
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - a clean and minimalistic React UI template

### Running the app

Install all dependencies and run the app (dev. mode)
The maps will not work in the application since the existing Google Maps API is not valid anymore.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
